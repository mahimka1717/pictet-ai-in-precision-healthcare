				"How AI could supercharge precision medicine",
				"Only a couple of decades ago, the time it took to sequence an individual’s genome would have consigned this information to academic papers, but <mark>AI</mark> is democratising its use. The Human Genome Project, which began in 1990 with the aim of mapping the entire human genome, took 13 years of painstaking work, as scientists copied each strand of DNA multiple times to determine the order in which genetic information fits together. Today, sequencing a person’s entire genetic structure costs about $600 and can be done in a matter of hours, as machines analyse multiple DNA strands simultaneously in a single tube.",
				"“We do this using artificial intelligence to compare the genomes of healthy and diabetic individuals,” says Professor Philippe Froguel, Head of Genomic Medicine at Imperial College London. “We then identify which genetic mutations can explain the disease and where there might be the risk of complication.”",
				"Multiple different models of AI are used, explains Froguel. One, known as “random forest”, runs population-sized samples of anonymised healthcare data through a series of decision trees, before calculating the average probability that a certain genetic mutation would become a driver for disease.",
				"The application of <mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark> has made larger population-wide tests possible. “We are sequencing the genomes of all the diabetic patients in the French-speaking part of Belgium,” says Professor Froguel. This not only allows doctors to determine the genetic drivers of diabetes, but also to identify contributing lifestyle factors in pre-diabetic individuals."

In 2020, Google’s AI lab DeepMind published a report demonstrating that its Deep Learning programme “AlphaFold” was able to predict the structure of proteins from a list of its component parts – something that had eluded structural biologists for more than 50 years.",
				"This creates the possibility of catching and preventing diseases such as Alzheimer’s, which are thought to result from the build-up of misshapen proteins. In January 2024, scientists at the University of Zurich published a paper which described how <mark>AI</mark> had helped them identify the biomarkers of long Covid across more than 6,500 different proteins."

                    "This not only provides more effective therapy, but also reduces the chances that someone will experience unwanted side effects, which account for <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2997315/' target='_blank'>6.5 per</a> cent of hospital admissions in Britain, according to the National Institutes of Health.",

Regulatory pathways that oblige drug makers to run multiple clinical trials before a product can enter the market are ill-designed for fast development cycles.
